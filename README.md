### 🗓 Day 02 – Constructors, Access Modifiers & OOPS Practice  
*Date:* 27 December 2025

On the second day of training, the focus was on understanding best practices in constructors, access modifiers, and applying OOPS concepts through hands-on practice programs.

#### Practice Programs Implemented

*Level 1 Constructor Practice*
- Book class with default and parameterized constructors.
- Circle class using constructor chaining.
- Person class with a copy constructor.
- Hotel Booking System using default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Library Book System with book borrowing functionality.
- Car Rental System with rental cost calculation.

*Instance vs Class Variables and Methods*
- Product Inventory Management system.
- Online Course Management system.
- Vehicle Registration system.

*Access Modifiers Practice*
- University Management System demonstrating public, protected, and private access.
- Book Library System with EBook subclass.
- Bank Account Management using SavingsAccount subclass.
- Employee Records with Manager subclass.

All programs were implemented using standard Java coding conventions and organized using proper package structure.

### 🗓 Day 3 – Static, Final & Object Behaviour  
*Date:* 29 December 2025

On the third day of training, the focus was on understanding important Java keywords and operators that control memory, immutability, and object behavior. Along with theory, multiple real-world practice programs and scenario-based problems were implemented to strengthen practical understanding.

#### Activities Completed
- Learned about core Java keywords and concepts:
  - static keyword (class-level variables and methods)
  - final keyword (constants, method prevention, and immutability)
  - instanceof operator (runtime object type checking)

- Developed practice programs using real-world entities:
  - BankAccount
  - Book
  - Library
  - Company
  - Patient
  - Product
  - Student
  - Vehicle

- Solved scenario-based logical problems:
  - *Parking Lot Gate System* 🚗
  - *The Number Guessing Game* 🎯
  - *Shopkeeper’s Discount Dashboard* 🛍️
  - *School Bus Attendance System* 🚍
  - *Phone Recharge Simulator* 📱

- Applied object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, class design, and method usage.
- Practiced writing clean, structured Java programs with proper naming conventions.
- Committed and pushed all completed programs to the remote repository using standard Git practices.

### 🗓 Day 4 – Object Oriented Design & Relationships  
*Date:* 30 December 2025

On the fourth day of training, the focus was on understanding *Object-Oriented Design principles* and modeling real-world systems using *UML diagrams* and *object relationships*. Practical problems were solved to strengthen conceptual clarity and design thinking.

#### Activities Completed
- Learned core *Object Oriented Design Principles*:
  - Class Diagram
  - Object Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram

- Understood and applied object relationships:
  - Association
  - Aggregation
  - Composition

- Solved assisted object-modeling problems:
  - *Library and Books* (Aggregation)
  - *Bank and Account Holders* (Association)
  - *Company and Departments* (Composition)

- Solved self-practice design problems:
  - *School and Students with Courses* (Association and Aggregation)
  - *University with Faculties and Departments* (Composition and Aggregation)
  - *Hospital, Doctors, and Patients* (Association and Communication)
  - *E-commerce Platform with Orders, Customers, and Products*
  - *University Management System*

- Focused on identifying correct relationships between classes based on real-world scenarios.
- Practiced communication between objects using method interactions.
- Improved understanding of system design before implementation.
- Followed clean class structure and naming conventions during problem-solving.

### 🗓 Day 5 – Inheritance & Polymorphism in Java  
*Date:* 31 December 2025
