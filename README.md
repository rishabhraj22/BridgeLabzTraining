🗓 Day 9 – Java OOPS Concepts, Scenario-Based Problems & Git Branch Management

(Date: 25-Dec-2025)

Studied and implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in Java, including:

Classes and objects

Encapsulation

Real-world modeling using Java classes

Solved Java programs based on OOPS concepts to understand how objects interact within a program.

Worked on scenario-based Java problems to apply core Java and OOPS knowledge to real-life use cases.

Focused on writing clean, readable, and logically structured code.

Practiced advanced Git workflow and branch management:

Used separate branches for different learning topics.

Ensured Java OOPS programs and scenario-based programs were committed to the correct branches.

Cleaned and organized the repository by:

Removing unnecessary and duplicate folders.

Deleting compiled .class files from version control.

Configuring .gitignore to ignore build and IDE-specific files permanently.

Followed professional Git practices:

Meaningful commit messages.

Safe file deletion using Git commands.

Maintaining a clean and structured commit history.

Successfully committed and pushed all relevant changes to the repository.
